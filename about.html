            This Study Tracker is designed to help you efficiently track 
            how many hours you truly study.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is especially useful as we often overestimate how long,
            we work/study for.
            According to <a href="https://www.nysscpa.org/news/publications/
            the-trusted-professional/article/study-people-overestimate-how-long
            -they-work-by-about-5-10-percent-110315">this study</a> we can overestimate our working
            hours by as much as 50%! 
        </p>
        <p>
            To combat this I have created this Study Hour Logger, where, whilst
            you study you can log your true hours worked.
            This will return a more accurate depiction of your workrate.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result you can take the necessary steps to improve it if it
            is lacking.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is recommended that in order to be as efficient as possible,
            you study in no more than 4-hour blocks. This is because of the
            concentration limitations of your brain. So once you hit those 4 hours
            go take a break and start another block!
        </p>
        <p>
            In future, we plan to add proper timers to the site or even perhaps,
            create a Google Extension.
